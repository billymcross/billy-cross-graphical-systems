Each of my presets was meant to explore some different shape in the physarum sim.

<<<<====DISINTEGRATE====>>>>
This preset is meant to make the simulation, well, disintegrate. It lowers the scan distance so that the agents will simply fly 
everywhere as a sort of cloud of dust. The main purpose of this preset is to effectively "reset" the simulation, as it obliterates
any existing patterns. From this preset, one can adjust parameters to settle the sim into new patterns.

<<<<====VINES====>>>>
This was a pattern I found in my early versions of violet lightning, which creates a pleasing network of sweeping curves. The high 
scan distance used in this pattern causes the agents to cluster together into contiguous lines, or "vines", rather than spreading
out. These vines tend to create curving, sweeping swirls that look very plant-like. Eventually, the vines tend to converge on more 
straight lines, but we can get the pattern back by cranking the scan distance to minimum, causing the agents to disperse. Then,
increasing the scan distance to maximum again will restore the pattern from the dispersed agents.

<<<<====OVERWHELM====>>>>
This pattern takes advantage of using >1 decay levels. This makes it so that the colors, rather than decaying and fading, get more 
intense over time. The combination of this and the the scan distance creates the same sort of vine shape as above, but said vines
get brighter and more intense, meaning that the screen starts to fill up with these organic pink shapes. The most intensity
will be of course at the intersections between vines, creating spots of bright intensity. In my interpretation, this looked almost
like an infection spreading and, fittingly, *overwhelming* the screen.

<<<<====HAZE====>>>>
This preset increases the turn angle divisor, and was one of the patterns I observed in my first experiments with physarum. With 
the turn angle divisor high, thus creating a small turn angle, the agents tend to cluster into a sort of gridlike pattern. With the 
high number of agents in the simulation, these grid patterns tend to make clouds that move across the screen like wisps of smoke,
hence the name "haze".
