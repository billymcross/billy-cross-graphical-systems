I had the idea for this piece in my head as soon as we properly introduced reaction diffusion, realizing that reaction diffusion 
could be used to make the cells coalesce into some kind of eerie "eye" shape, and I'm glad I could actually make it 
a reality. This piece is my foray into making abstract, avant-garde weirdness, and as such is very intentionally designed to be 
off-putting and difficult to look at. This is probably odd coming from me, considering how much I disliked the eye-hurting work of
Ryoji Ikeda, but in doing this project I've realized the value in that kind of work--the sort that gets in your face and 
confounds you. At the same time, it's not JUST random noise -- as mentioned above, I had a distinct idea for the shape of this piece,
where the reaction resolves into a jumble of static surrounding a single central "eye" staring eerily at the viewer. This was 
achieved through the "orientation" option of reaction diffusion, as the diffusion rate of B is scaled based on the distance from the
center of the screen, creating a circular shape that morphs into increasingly aggressive static moving outwards. Additionally, I 
scaled the diffusion rate based on time elapsed, meaning that the static becomes noisier and, in my experience, both more unpleasant
and more *fascinating* at the same time. The interaction keys that manipulate the values of the reaction diffusion allow for more 
styles on this initial concept; for example, increasing the diffusion rates can amplify the aggressive static, or increasing the 
kill rate will result in locations that have no A or B chemical in them, leading to empty black spaces between the oscillating white,
with the only red being a glow in the central eye.

Side note: the name "eye_of_HORUS" is derived from the organization/cult/paracausal entity "Horus" from the tabletop roleplaying 
game Lancer. In Lancer, Horus manifests strange, unexplained technology throughout the universe, and its off-putting, occult stylings
greatly resonate with me because, to be blunt, I really like *weird artsy stuff*.
