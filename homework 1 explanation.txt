With my shaders, I used some of the examples in the book and lessons as a jumping off point from which to experiment. I initially created a sinusoid pattern with the 
smoothstep() function that, when left running for sufficiently long, turned into this interesting pattern of cascading lines. I intentionally scaled up the time value used in
that step to get the desired effect, and from there zeroed in on focusing on lines as my main aesthetic. I used sinusoids and tangents to create patterns of oscillating 
glowing lines that would move across the screen in sync, creating an aesthetically pleasing rhythm that began with simple straight lines and ended with a spiral of
sine waves as the background cascaded downwards. Beyond the basic shapes, I wanted to focus on color in the animation as well, so I chose a blue to pink to red gradient that
all the shapes used.

My feedback from my classmates actually matched my expectations. The two people who I showed the shader to both said that the background, and specifically the way it cascaded
at the end of the animation, reminded them of rain, with the glowing lines evoking the northern lights. This was exactly my intent with the final product; I realized the 
background of cascaded lines looked very rain-like, and so had it change to that cascading pattern in the finale to match with the downward spiral of the sine waves.
